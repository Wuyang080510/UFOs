# UFOs
Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a dynamic webpage showcasing UFO sightings worldwide.

## Overview
In this project, I created a dynamic webpage showcasing UFO sightings around the world. Five filters are available for users to filter UFO sightings based on specific criteria. Basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS are used to build and style the webpage. Javascript is used to make a responsive table, create functions to collect input values as filters, and deploy the change to HTML. 

## Purpose of the Project
- Familiarize JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions
- Convert Javascript functions to arrow functions
- Build and deploy forEach() to complete for loops in JavaScript

## Results
Five filters with default values are built with JavaScript and HTML. Users can filter the UFO sightings table by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.

Each filter works independently. To filter the data, users can enter a value in the corresponding filter box to filter the table base on specific criteria.

Users can also filter the table with multiple criteria. As the image shows, the table was filtered by the state and shape of the UFO.

If users want to reset the table to its default look, users can click the blank space to do this. 

## Summary
This webpage is a good start for summarizing UFO sightings information in one place. However, the filter values are case sensitive as the values in the dataset are lowercase. Users have to be careful about the letter case of input values. Furthermore, a statistical summary of the UFO sightings would be a good addition to this page. And it would be great to add the most current news of UFO sightings.
